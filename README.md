# My FreeCAD Macros

## Description

This repository contains a collection of macros designed for use with FreeCAD, specifically aimed at enhancing productivity and simplifying common tasks. 

### Check Interference Macro

The **Check Interference** macro allows users to identify and analyse interferences between selected bodies in the active FreeCAD document. It examines the geometry of the selected objects to determine if they intersect or overlap. If any interferences are detected, a message box will display the results, informing the user of the specific bodies involved.

This tool is particularly useful for validating assemblies and ensuring adequate clearances in complex models. 

## Usage

To use the macros, simply load them in FreeCAD and follow the prompts to perform the desired operations.
